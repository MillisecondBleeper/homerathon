		<p>We are so excited to be continuing the tradition of the Homerathon at UNL. This year's Homerathon will be similar to last year in that we will be doing a video/podcast style reading. </p>
		<p>The reading this year will be of the <em>Trojan Women</em> by Euripides. The video will be posted on soon. Be sure to check back here to watch the video our students created.</p>
		<p>Thank you, as always, for supporting UNLâ€™s Homerathon by your continued interest!</p>
		<p>While we're waiting for the main event, please enjoy this wonderful teaser trailer courtesy of Chancellor Green! You can also watch last year's performance <strong><a href="/2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homerathon 2021: The Homeric Hymns</a></strong>.</p>
