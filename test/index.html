	<p>We are so excitted to be continuing the tradition of the Homerathon at UNL. This year's Homerathon will be similar to last year in that we will be doing a video/podcast style reading. This year, however, we are adding a community element to it! After the video has been up for a bit, we will have a Zoom Q &#38 A. The video podcast will be available April 21st. Zoom discussion TBA.</p>
