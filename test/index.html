		<p>We are so excited to be continuing the tradition of the Homerathon at UNL. This year's Homerathon will be similar to last year in that we will be doing a video/podcast style reading. This year, however, we are adding a community element to it in the form of a virtual Q&A! </p>
		<p>The reading this year will be of the <em>Homeric Hymns</em>. The video will be posted the morning of May 13th, with the Q&A being held at 6:00 p.m. CDT on May 14th. Be sure to check back here to watch the video our students create and to join our community as we discuss it after.</p>
		<p>Thank you, as always, for supporting UNLâ€™s Homerathon by your continued interest!</p>
		<p>While we're waiting for the main event, please enjoy this wonderful teaser trailer courtesy of Chancellor Green! You can also watch last year's Homerathon <a href="/_layouts/default.html">here</a>.</p>
